//! What terminal agents leave behind: when they were working, and what it cost.
//!
//! Two agents, two formats, the same two questions. Both keep a file per session
//! under a directory of their own, and both write one JSON object per line, so
//! both are read the same way — a line at a time, parsing only the lines that
//! could carry what is wanted.
//!
//! Reading these matters more than it looks. Measurement of one month's record
//! found eight thousand minutes in which the editor saw an agent write code and
//! thirteen thousand further minutes in which only a terminal agent was working:
//! more work happening outside the editor's view than inside it. A measure built
//! on the editor alone does not merely undercount those hours, it fills them in
//! by interpolation, which is a guess where there is evidence to be had.
//!
//! Reading the files rather than asking the agents to report also gives the
//! record its history: a hook installed today knows nothing about last month,
//! and these files go back as far as the agent has been used.
//!
//! Nothing but a timestamp, a model name and a count of tokens is taken. The
//! files also hold working directories, prompts, shell commands, tool output and
//! the contents of edited files; none of that is read. That is also why a moment
//! from here carries no language: the only place these transcripts name a file is
//! inside the text of a shell command, and reading that to guess an extension
//! would mean reading the one thing this promised not to.
